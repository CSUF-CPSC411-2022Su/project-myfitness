    //Things that need to be added to Feature 3:
    //1. look for an API that has recipes that are healthy.
    //2. Create a view controller and start to design how you want viewcontroller to look like. [DONE]
    //3. Implement functions that will help with feature and write comments as you go to make sure you understand what is happening in the code.
    //4. Unit testing once functions are created to ensure feature is working correctly.
